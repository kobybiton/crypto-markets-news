    </div>
    <div class="terms-of-service">
       
        <h4 class="offset-top-45 text-bold text-normal font-accent-2">Introduction</h4>
        <p class="offset-top-15">
           We, at Israel Miriam Holdings Ltd., a company registered in Israel ("<bold>we</bold>", "<bold>us</bold>", "<bold>our</bold>", or "<bold>Company</bold>"), respect the privacy of our users (each, "you" or "User") and are committed to protecting any privacy of Users who access, visit, or engage with our website, available at http://www.crypto-markets.news, as well as any other websites the Company owns and that link to this privacy policy (collectively: the "<bold>Websites</bold>").
This privacy policy will help you understand what types of information we collect through the Websites, how the Company uses it, and what choices you have. We encourage you to read this privacy policy carefully and use it to make informed decisions.
        </p>
        <h4 class="offset-top-45 text-bold text-normal font-accent-2">Collection and Storage of Your Personal Information </h4>
        <p class="offset-top-15">
            We collect and use the following types of information about you:
<bold> Personal Information</bold><br><br>
Personal Information is information that identifies an individual or that may, with reasonable effort, identify an individual. We gather the following types of Personal Information:
<ul>
<li><bold>Name, email address, and other contact information:</bold> We ask for and—at your option—collect your contact data (such as name and email address) from you when you submit web forms on our Websites, including opportunities to sign up for and agree to receive email communications from us. We also may ask you to submit such Personal Information if you choose to use interactive features of the Websites, including submitting your comments to the articles published on the Websites, requesting customer support, or otherwise communicating with us. We will send such communications in accordance with applicable law.</li>
<li><bold>Voluntary information:</bold> We collect Personal Information that Users provide us voluntarily. For example, when they respond to communications from us, or when they share additional information through their use of the Websites. </li>
<li><bold>Device information:</bold> We collect from our Users specific types of connection details and information with regard to their device, software or hardware that may identify them, such as online identifiers, device unique identifiers (e.g. UDID, MAC address), IP address and geolocation.</li>
<li><bold>Analytics data:</bold> Our servers automatically record certain information regarding the use of our Websites, using third-party analytics providers such as Google Analytics and Inspectlet. Such data may include information such as the website that you were visiting before accessing our Websites and other statistics related to our Websites. We also perform statistical analysis on all of the data and metadata which is collected through our Websites. We use this information to administer the Websites and analyze this information to improve and enhance the Websites by expanding their features and functionality. Such data is also used for troubleshooting errors and bugs as well as for research and analytics purposes about your use of the Websites.</li>
<li><bold>Information from your social networks:</bold> You can use some of the Websites through a link to your social networks accounts (such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.). In these cases, Personal Information about you may be transmitted to us according to the terms of use and the permissions you have set in your accounts. </li>
</ul>
<bold> Non-personal Information </bold><br><br>
Non-personal Information is non-identifiable information that, when taken alone, cannot be used to identify you. As such, we are not aware of the identity of the user from which the Non-personal Information was collected.
We may anonymize or de-identify the information collected by the Websites or via other means so that the information cannot, on its own, personally identify you. We also collect aggregate user data regarding your use and activity on our Websites. Our use and disclosure of such aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this privacy policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation and for any purpose.
For the avoidance of doubt, if we combine Personal Information with Non-personal Information (e.g. analytics data), the combined information will be treated as Personal Information as long as it remains combined.

        <h4 class="offset-top-45 text-bold text-normal font-accent-2">How we Use Personal Information</h4>

        <p class="offset-top-15">
            We work with other companies who help us run our business (“Service Providers”). These companies provide services to help us store information (such as cloud storage companies), deliver customer support, monitor and analyze the performance of our Websites, as well as sales leads, provide marketing support, and otherwise operate and improve our Websites. These Service Providers may only process Personal Information pursuant to our instructions and in compliance both with this privacy policy and other applicable confidentiality and security measures and regulations.<br><br>
Specifically, we do not permit our Service Providers to use any Personal Information we share with them for their own marketing purposes or for any other purpose than in connection with the services they provide to us.<br><br>
